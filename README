OAuth 2.0 Provider

An attmpt to implement the OAuth 2.0 token provider part of the OAuth 2.0 
protocol written in Python.  It uses Cherrypy as the web framework, Cheetah to
provide an html templating language, and your choice of ZODB 3.0, mongodb or a
planned Postgre database backend.

This currently does not implement all the flows, but plans are in place to do 
so.

There is also plans to implement a fully functional web interface to manage 
clients, and client user associations.

This only implements draft OAuth 2.0 version 22
